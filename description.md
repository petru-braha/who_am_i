I'm a first-year student in Computer Science looking forward to build his mind as well as his career. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and cryptography caught my attention. After graduation, I'm motivated to have a closer look at research programs in these areas (I already have some experience researching). 

However, at the moment, the priority is to learn the basics. One of the most suitable experiences, which will get me in touch with the actual technologies, is an internship. I consider it the most valuable starting-up step for my career. I see myself collaborating with a professional team and building real and useful contributions together. Any given insight, resource, training or certificate from the company will be meaningful background for me. 

Energy, social skills, and creativity are some of my attributes; I can undertake any task with enthusiasm. My experience is constructed in a practical and social manner. My next step is focused only on IT's world. I can't wait to start learning new things and to achieve more!

Don’t hesitate to contact me if additional information is needed. I'm flexible, open-minded and I would love a chance to collaborate.
