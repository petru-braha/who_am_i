Basic stuff:
- each project includes a README file with a complex description. here is just a summary (in cronological order) of all my experience so far.
- to test a project, it's recommended to download its folder

the list of my projects: 
1. BetterWR (C, C++)
   = compress or decompress data and includes:
      - file explorer (done using graphics.h)
      - Huffman trees
      - Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm
   - requirements: at least gcc 17, 32 bit compiler

2. implementation of the studied data structures
   - BT (binary tree, complete binary tree)
   - T (general tree, disjoint set collection)
   - MH (maxheap - array implementation)

next to be done:
    
    - BST (binary search tree)
    - G (graph, diagraph)
    - DT (digital tree, tries)
    - Hash tables (2 implementations)
